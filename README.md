## Install npm from node webpage
## Open the folder in terminal
## Once Opened run npm install
## once the terminal is done with all the dependencies you can run the app using
## npm start


## Issues you might face while running the project?

## The suprise me button is used to create a random index of the review section

## but It might not show randomly that is because there is no check on if 
##the new index is similar to the previous index.
## Think of it as an coding challenge and try to tackle it yourself Thanks!!
